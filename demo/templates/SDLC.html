<h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
<h2>Project Overview Documentation</h2>
<textbubbles>
	<h1>Project Specification</h1>
	<h3>Requirements Definition</h3>
	<p>
		The software engineering project is a web-based learning platform that allows users to create, manage, and take custom quizzes. This feature aims to enhance student engagement and facilitate self-directed learning by providing an interactive environment where quizzes can be easily created, stored, and accessed through a user-friendly interface. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The application enables users to log in, access flashcards, take multiple-choice quizzes on various subjects, and record their project progress, including the date, title, details of activities, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. This task focuses on experience with Flask routing, SQLite database interactions, and basic web templating using Jinja, while also emphasising key security concepts, such as transitioning from storing plain-text passwords to implementing secure password hashing.
	</p>

	<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>User Authentication: Implement signup/login/logout with an initial insecure approach (plain-text passwords in SQLite), then upgrade to secure (hashed passwords using Werkzeug). Use sessions to persist user state.</li>
		<li>Database Setup: Create a SQLite database with tables for Users (id, username, password, email)</li>
		<li>Progress Logs (id, user_id, date, title, details, image_path nullable)</li>
		<li>Quiz (Preset quizzes for history and geography, alongside with a function to create new custom quizzes.)</li>
		<li>Use SQL files for table creation.</li>
		<li>Progress Logging of development process: A form to add logs (date, title, details) and a view to display user-specific logs, stored in the database.</li>
		<li>Basic Quiz Interface: A simple frontend to display flashcards and multiple-choice quizzes for one subject. </li>
		<li>Users can submit answers and see feedback</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Non-functional requirements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The codebase should have a clear structure for learning purposes.</li>
		<li>Be easy to run locally with minimal dependencies.</li>
		<li>Lightweight, with no unnecessary packages.</li>
		<li>Use Flask for backend routing and Jinja for templating (e.g., base.html for inheritance).</li>
		<li>Demonstrate insecure vs. secure practices</li>
		<li>Plain-text vs. hashed passwords; raw vs. parameterised queries in code and documentation.</li>
		<li>Code must be version-controlled with Git (include repository link in submission). </li>
		<li>App should handle basic errors (e.g., flash messages for invalid login)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Constraints</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use only Flask, sqlite3 (no SQLAlchemy), and built-in Python libraries (e.g., datetime).</li>
		<li>Install Werkzeug for hashing.</li>
		<li>Limit to one subject for quizzes in this prototype.</li>
		<li>No PWA features (e.g., service workers) or voice/ML yet.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Users can register and login, authenticating into the app.</li>
		<li>Users can successfully create a quiz, add multiple-choice questions and save them to the database.</li>
		<li>Users can view a list of quizzes they have created, and quiz details display correctly.</li>
		<li>Quiz-taking functionality works as expected, with correct answers recorded and feedback displayed immediately.</li>
		<li>All pages render correctly on desktop and mobile devices, and navigation is consistent across the platform.</li>
		<li>Security measures (password hashing, SQL parameterisation) are implemented and functional.</li>
		<li>The application performs reliably under normal usage without errors or crashes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Waterfall Model and Agile Method Uses</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Waterfall Model: Used for initial planning, requirements gathering, and design phases to establish a clear project scope and structure.</li>
		<li>Agile Methodology: Employed during development and testing phases, allowing for an iterative progress and regular feedback, with adaptability to changes and allowing for improvements based on testing outcomes with my PWA.</li>
		<li>Waterfall provided a solid foundation at the start, while Agile enabled for flexibility and responsiveness during coding and refinement.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
<h3>Writing Code</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Front End: HTML and CSS, utilising Jinja templating for dynamic rendering.</li>
	<li>Back End: Python (Flask), and JavaScript.</li>
	<li>Begin by writing the source code using programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
	<li>All code is created in direct alignment with the functional and non-functional requirements established earlier.</li>
	<li>Basic required features are added into the code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example of the Back End:</h3>

<h3>Example of the Front End:</h3>
<div class="example-image">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='sprites/example_screenshots/frontend.png') }}" alt="frontend_example">
</div>

<h3>Implementation of Key Functionality</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each core feature outlined in the design phase is implemented during development. This includes constructing the system’s logic.</li>
    <li>Functionality includes quiz handling, progress tracking, authentication, and flashcard creation.</li>
    <li>User interface elements are developed to support a responsive user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security—Werkzeug & Login Functionality to Prevent SQL Injection</h3>
<ul>
    <li>User authentication is implemented using Flask and Werkzeug for secure storage of sensitive user data.</li>
    <li>Passwords are hashed using generate_password_hash and verified with check_password_hash, preventing storage of plain-text passwords.</li>
    <li>Parameterised SQL queries are used for all login and registration forms to prevent SQL injection attacks.</li>
    <li>User input is never inserted into SQL statements as plain text; instead, placeholders (?) are used, and user-provided data is safely passed as query parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>System Testing & Validation</h3>
<h4>Testing For Security Risks — Bandit</h4>
<p>
	Bandit is a security linter for Python code that identifies common security issues. It scans the codebase for potential vulnerabilities and provides recommendations for remediation. By running Bandit on my app.py, it allows for an automatic scan of the Flask project for common security vulnerabilities. Running Bandit allowed me to identify weak points in the codebase early and ensure safer handling of user input, sessions, and database interactions, such as identifying that the debug mode being set as true allows a potential injection point.

<h4>Evaluation</h4>
<p>
	Overall, the project managed to successfully meet the initial specificiations and requirements outlined in the SDLC document. The core functionalities, including the user authentication system, quiz creation and management, flashcard functions and progress logging were implemented effectively. The next steps would be to further improve the user interface for better usuability, cleaning up the codebase for maintainability, and adding more features such as analytics and additional quiz subjects. Security measures were also successfully implemented, transitioning from insecure practices to more secure methods using password hashing and parameterised queries. Testing confirmed that the application performs reliably under normal usage without errors or crashes, fulfilling the acceptance criteria set.
